10/8 additions from Kadima:
As of right now, the user can enter the sheets from the Excel file that they would like to analyze, alongside the specific column from the sheet to investigate. However, the user will have to know exactly what they want to search for in a particular column.
Challenges:
- The only downside as of right now is that the search function  does not work for certains sheets in the excel files and columns.
- Unable to read integers
- Space matters
Future focus for Sprint 2:
- Make the search function to be based on the ownerâ€™s name.
- Get rid of spacing problem

10/8 change from Grube:
- added requirements.txt
